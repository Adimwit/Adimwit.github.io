What compels one to write a blog? It is a question that has plagued my mind for many years, but I did not actively seek a solution (a hasty response was not ranked highly, if at all, on my to-do list). Today though, I can finally answer that for myself.

A friend of mine sputnik (you can find his blog [here][friend]) at the beginning of the year challenged me to write a daily blog about something I found interesting or learned about. I am hesitant about writing one because the sheer amount of time and dedication into a blog can be, at times, very taxing. One of my New Year's resolution involved learning some new skills, whether it be a new programming language, software, or of the interest. As a matter of fact, my web development skills are quite subpar, a factor contributing to this hesitation. Nevertheless, my competitive nature did not allow me to turn this challenge down and so here I am, writing my first post.

I'll start off my very first post with why I chose "Adimwit". Long story short, about 10 years ago, I was at a friend's playing on their pc under the account name "Adimwit". A very peculiar nickname at the time, I did not consider having an alias of such degree until I came upon the Github account name creation page. Being witty at the time, I decided to recall a name from the past, and from then on, I was known as Adimwit. There is a saying: "don't judge a book by its cover". I intend to live up to this quote.

As for what I will write about in my future blogs, I plan to discuss things that I learn along the way: tricks that I didn't know of, concepts learned in class that I think deserves the spotlight and my own thoughts if they warrant such mentioning. I would also like to give some attention to the projects I am involved in and provide ample information along the lines of current progress and what is/isn't working.

As of writing this post, I am currently using a basic webpage outline provided to me by Jekyll as well as getting some very helpful tips by [sputnik][friend]. For the first few posts, I will have a small section detailing what I did (including some code snippet). From this blog, I hope to learn much more about web development through an active approach by using search engines to my advantage. 

I end this first post here, but rest assured future posts will include pictures to lighten the reading (as soon as I figure out how to add them).
