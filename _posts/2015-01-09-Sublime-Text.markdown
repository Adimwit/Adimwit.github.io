Today I discuss the tool I use to write my blog posts called [Sublime Text][sublime]. Recommended to me by Daimian Mercer, a developer for the EVE Online game's wormhole mapping tool called [Tripwire][tripwire]. Sublime Text is an amazing text editor that caters to those seeking an alternative to Notepad without breaking the bank. Here are some of the features I found useful:

<h1>Syntax Highlighting</h1>

The ability to highlight syntax between different languages is awesome. Seeing where one part of a code begins and ends in a swamp of text because its shaded in a different color shaves time spent looking for them.

<h1>Shortcuts</h1>

There are some really intriguing shortcuts in Sublime that will blow your mind when you use them. My favorite shortcut is ```Ctrl + F2```; the ability to bookmark lines in the file and cycle through the file (especially if there are tons of lines) makes returning to the line you need to look for a piece of cake (the cake is a lie).

<h1>The Command Palette</h1>

Sublime includes less commonly used commands in a UI called the Command Palette. I haven't used this yet, but I can imagine a time where this would come in handy if I could not remember the shortcut.

The best part about Sublime Text? You can use it across all 3 platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux. I am currently using the free version (sublime 2) offered by the website as an unlicensed version, but I will definitely get the license some time in the future (a 70 dollar purchase for an upgrade to Sublime Text 3 as well as removing those annoying "Trial Version messages"). The days when I used Notepad to write code are over.
