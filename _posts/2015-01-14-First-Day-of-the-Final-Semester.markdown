Today is the first day of my (hopefully) final semester. I say "hopefully" because I estimate that I will be taking 19 college credits for a total of 6 courses. This leads me into the post for today, time. My blogs have begun slowing down as of late and I find it harder to maintain a good schedule for writing daily blogs. With school starting and all the clubs and activities that I am involved in, writing blogs are one of the last things I do for the day.

Since this blog writing on a nightly basis isn't working out too well for me, I've decided to write these during the day. Maybe the change will be beneficial. Maybe not. Still, it's better to change something that won't work in the long run than keep doing it. That's all for today sadly, but the next post will be about my musings on memory.
