I've been reading HelloSputnik's blogs and came across a post he recently made detailing what [Google Analytics][analytics] was (you can read his post [here][post]). To sum it up, you have the ability to track what pages are being looked at, how long time is spent on a page, even what part of the world the user is viewing the site from.

For a small project like my blog, I don't really need to see numbers pertaining to view count and what page gets the most view time, but for big time sites that get large traffic, I can only imagine what they do with this amount of data. I've decided to add this tool to my website anyways in the off chance that I may have to use a similar software in the future.

Thanks to Sputnik for his post and Google for creating this service!

I wanted to see see what other services Google offered and stumbled across [Google Webmaster Tools][webmaster] which expands upon its Analytics tool by providing you with the ability to manage your overall website as well as give you the option to choose which country you would prefer your website to be viewed by. The amount of control you can have on your own website is amazing as a developer.
