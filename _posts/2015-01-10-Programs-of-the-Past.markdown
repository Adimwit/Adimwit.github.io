With the Facebook Hacker Cup Qualifier Round ending soon (only 20 hours to go!), I've decided to look over one of my old Java projects to familiarize myself with concepts that I may have forgotten, resolve any mistakes I may have made, and reminisce of the sleepless nights I've spent over it.

<h1>Advance Wars</h1>

Created by a team of 3 members for a programming course on Object-Oriented Programming over a span of 4 weeks, the project was a re-imagination of the original hand-held game Advance Wars. To summarize the project, we were to clone our childhood inspiration into Java. Of the responsibilities I was tasked with, the most memorable was implementing audio. 

Sometimes, remembering the things that brings nostalgia can become a huge drive that propels you towards your goal. In this case, the game music pushed me to my limits. The more time I spent the more effort I wanted to put in to complete it so I could play it and hear every second of my hard work.

Unfortunately, all I did was remind myself of the good old times that I didn't bother too much to look into the actual code itself. I am proud of what I have done with this project though and I hope I can find the drive in every project that I work on to make it successful.
