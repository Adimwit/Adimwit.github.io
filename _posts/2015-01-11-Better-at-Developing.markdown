These past few days, I've begun reading other blogs besides HelloSputnik's. The result is paralyzing to say the least. Some posts are about personal life, others are technical, and anything else you can think of could have probably been in a blog at one point or another. In the Coding Horror's blog though, I came across an interesting article by Jeff Atwood titled [How to Become a Better Programmer by Not Programming][codinghorror].

Jeff looks to two quotes to send his message across; one quote by an online group called Design Observer and another by Bill Gates in his 2005 interview. The idea is that, to some extent, learning about code can make you a better programmer, but it is everything else around programming that separates a good developer from a "mediocre" one. 

By looking outside the box of programming, you will find interactions between other developers, users, and those in the industry related to your product. I find that the userbase is the most important aspect when it comes to designing a product. After all, no matter how good you are at writing code, it all becomes useless if the users don't enjoy it.

I definitely recommend a complete read of Jeff's post as there's more to it than what I just posted, but I will leave some small advice to what I said above. The ability to understand what a user wants in a program, in my opinion, is key to programming. In my next post, I will discuss my experiences with Facebook's qualifying round.
