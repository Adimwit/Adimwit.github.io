Today [Facebook's Hacker Cup 2015][hackercup] Qualification Round begins. I am extremely excited to be part of this competition hosted by Facebook and am ready to stretch my programming muscles. To pass the qualification round, there are 3 problems to solve and only 1 has to be correct. Of course, getting all 3 solutions correct will be my goal. At the time of this writing, I have 67 hours left before the qualifying round ends, so there is no rush to complete anytime soon.

The problems presented are very interesting, but I probably won't discuss them until the round is over to respect Facebook's spirit of competition. My programming language of choice will have to be Java this time around even though I've been working in C for about 4 months or so. I believe that the ability to use JUnit testing will give me the edge when it counts (to tell the truth, I'm still not familiar with the GNU Debugger). If I come along a question that requires a solution meet an expected run time, I will switch to C for more memory management.

I am going to be preoccupied with the competition for awhile so I will leave you guys with my next topic for tomorrow, [Sublime Text][sublime]!
