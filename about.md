My name is Kevin Huynh and I am a student at the University of Arizona studying computer science and mathematics. I am also the club president of the university Chess Club for the 2014-2015 year. When I am not busy with schoolwork and club activities, I enjoy fencing, tennis, and the occasional site-seeing with my road bike. Indoors, I take to flying spaceships in EVE Online and any games that pique my interest (especially strategy games like Civ5 and Endless Legend). My tastes in music can be attributed to my love for playing the piano and violin.

Between school and all of my hobbies, I am researching game theory to determine whether it is possible to create an artificial intelligence that can predict logical outcomes based solely on said theory. By using the Nash Equilibrium as a foundation, I hope to analyze the many intricate variations in an effort to find possible candidates to mirror the AI after in an attempt to find such a correlation.d
